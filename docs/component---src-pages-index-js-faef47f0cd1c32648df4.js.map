treated as a timestamp.\n\t *\n\t * If an argument is a string, the function tries to parse it.\n\t * Function accepts complete ISO 8601 formats as well as partial implementations.\n\t * ISO 8601: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601\n\t *\n\t * If all above fails, the function passes the given argument to Date constructor.\n\t *\n\t * @param {Date|String|Number} argument - the value to convert\n\t * @param {Object} [options] - the object with options\n\t * @param {0 | 1 | 2} [options.additionalDigits=2] - the additional number of digits in the extended year format\n\t * @returns {Date} the parsed date in the local time zone\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // Convert string '2014-02-11T11:30:30' to date:\n\t * var result = parse('2014-02-11T11:30:30')\n\t * //=> Tue Feb 11 2014 11:30:30\n\t *\n\t * @example\n\t * // Parse string '+02014101',\n\t * // if the additional number of digits in the extended year format is 1:\n\t * var result = parse('+02014101', {additionalDigits:
