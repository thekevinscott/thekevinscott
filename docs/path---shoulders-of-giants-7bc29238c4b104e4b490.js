If you want it to learn to recognize dogs, you feed it images of dogs.</p>\n<p>As part of my initial foray into learning AI, I\'ve been working through the <a href="http://fast.ai" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">fast.ai</a> courses, and one of the very first assignments begins by leveraging a pre-trained model (specifically <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/keras/vgg16" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">VGG16</a>, trained to identify 1000 categories of images based on the <a href="http://www.image-net.org" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">corpus of data from ImageNet</a>), and build your training model on top of that, to identify dogs and cats. So you\'re taking the predictions from the VGG16 model - which could be one a 1000 items - and whittling that down to 2 - cat or dog.</p>\n<p>It makes perfect sense that you\'d build models like this; why train from scratch if someone has already done the training work beforehand?</p>\n<p>Imagine a scenario where you\'re training a model for use in teaching native English speakers to speak Spanish. Instead of training your model from scratch, you could leverage a pre-trained model that already recognizes human voices. Maybe you also leverage a model that understands the English and Spanish languages. Your final model might be a thin layer on top of both of these pre-existing models, that specifically learns how to interpret English accents mangling Spanish words.</p>\n<p>In particular, I wonder how this will affect design.</p>\n<p>There\'s been some preliminary work around <a href="https://blog.floydhub.com/turning-design-mockups-into-code-with-deep-learning/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">turning design mockups into code with deep learning</a>. Imagine startiing with a hand-drawn sketch as your base. You click around the sketch, nudging, encouraging and discouraging the AI: "No no, that button should open a new page", or "that link should create a new widget". You could use pre-trained models to help you where appropriate. Building a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CRUD app</a>? Grab a pre-built model off the shelf that knows how to create, delete, and update. How about Uber for dogs? Grab a pre-built Uber model, and train a new layer on top to recognize dogs instead of humans.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the cool thing about neural networks: you don’t have to tell them what to find. They decide what they want to find in order to solve your problem. — <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kwQEBMandw&#x26;feature=youtu.be&#x26;t=12m22s" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Jeremy Howard</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This layered approach to making neural nets smarter - by building on the shoulders of other, pre-trained nets - it blows my mind. It feels like programming from the future. Today we write instructions for computers to execute (a few levels abstracted from entering binary 0\'s and 1\'s), in a future language we could use increasingly abstract language to describe the parameters of what the computer should achieve, and then let the computer figure it out.</p>',timeToRead:2,frontmatter:{date:null,path:"/shoulders-of-giants/",title:"Standing on the shoulders of giants",image:null}}},pathContext:{}}}});
