On the web, it’s common to tab through forms, an intuitive and [UX-friendly
pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/web-form-design/). You get this out of
the box with web forms, but when building apps with React Native, you need to
implement this functionality yourself. Fortunately, it’s a cinch to set up.

## Native Form UX vs. Web Form UX

First, let’s understand what native UX we’re trying to emulate on React Native.

Here’s a video of navigation through the native iOS contacts app:

And here’s a video of navigation through a Web form:

<embed height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JN_y8E4Erh8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen="1" caption="Web form"></embed>

In summary, the iOS web browser gives us next and previous buttons, but for a native iOS app, these aren’t present, and [React Native doesn’t support them natively, either](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/641#issuecomment-94522058).

I believe the reason for this discrepancy is that, natively, the “return” key performs double duty, tabbing through the form and submitting once the form is complete. On the web, the “return” key will submit the form by default, necessitating the next/previous buttons.

We’ll focus on emulating the native functionality, relying on the “return” key
to tab through the form and submit it when complete.

## Keyboards and TextInput on React Native

We’ll be using `TextInput` and `View` from the `react-native` library, like so:

    import {
      TextInput,
      View,
    } from 'react-native';

Each `TextInput` [defines its own keyboard that appears when
focused](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#keyboardtype).
This allows a particular input field to specify `numeric`, `numpad`, or a number
of different options.

`TextInput`s are also responsible for determining which input to send focus to
next, and [they provide a handy prop for implementing
this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#onsubmitediting).

## Capturing the field reference

The first thing we’ll need is to capture the `ref` of a particular input field.

If you’re not familiar, [a
](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html)`ref`[ is a
reference to the React
component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html). It’s
best practice to specify a callback function and capture the referenced
component from the arguments.

In our example, we’re storing each `TextInput`‘s ref on an internal `inputs`
object we’ll define in the constructor. **We specify a custom index we’ll use
later to focus on the input.**

    <TextInput

      ref={ input => {

        this.inputs['one'] = input;

      }}

      ...

    />

Since the ref is defined in the `render` function, don’t store the reference
with `setState`; [doing so will cause an infinite
loop](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/5591) andmany tears will be shed.

## Triggering focus

Next, we need to focus on the next element. We do that by hooking into the
`onSubmitEditing` prop and supplying it with a custom focus function on the
component.

    onSubmitEditing={() => {

      // specify the key of the ref, as done in the previous section.

      this.focusNextField('next-field');

    }}

Then, we set up the field. If we zoom out to the component level:

    class App extends React.Component {

      constructor(props) {

        super(props);

        this.focusNextField = this.focusNextField.bind(this);

        // to store our input refs

        this.inputs = {};

      }

      focusNextField(key) {

        this.inputs[key].focus();

      }

      ...

    }

Two things to point out:

* [We need to bind the focus
function](http://egorsmirnov.me/2015/08/16/react-and-es6-part3.html) to the
class so we have an accurate reference to `this`. This is generally done in the
constructor.
* The focus action accepts a key indicating which input to focus on. That key
matches what we use in the `ref` callback above.

## Avoiding the disappearing keyboard

Sometimes as we’re tabbing between fields, the keyboard will disappear and
reappear. We can avoid this by using a prop on `TextInput` called
`blurOnSubmit`:

    <TextInput

      blurOnSubmit={ false }

      ...

    />

This property forces the keyboard to remain visible. Since we’re immediately
tabbing to our next field, this behavior works nicely for us.

## Return key

Updating [the return
key](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#returnkeytype)
to match the correct action isn’t strictly necessary (and natively iOS doesn’t
change its appearance) but I think updating to the relevant return key type is a
nice touch:

    <TextInput

      returnKeyType={ "next" }

      ...

    />

    <TextInput

      returnKeyType={ "done" }

      ...

    />

This indicates how to show a `done` return key on the final input, and a
`next`return key on the rest of em.
