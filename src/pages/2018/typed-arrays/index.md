## A word on Typed Arrays

A history of JS typed arrays.

Typed Arrays are a relatively new feature in the world of Javascript. They were introduced because of X. You need them when workin with WEbGL which Tensorflow does.

I found it useful to go through a refresher on these bad boys, since they're so at the core of all this stuff.

Tensors are the building blocks of any machine learning project. Tensor flow is literally named after them. 

In this article we'll talk about what a tensor is and how it's built in JAVASCRIPT.
