Hi friend, I hope you enjoy the presentation!

# Slides

[Here is a link to the slides](https://thekevinscott.github.io/presentations-libertyjs/).

# Code Demos

In the talk I mention a number of code demos demonstrating neural nets in the browser. Links to each can be found here:

* [line](https://codepen.io/thekevinscott/pen/yRZoev) &mdash; train a simple neural network on a line
* [moons](https://codepen.io/thekevinscott/project/editor/DvGbxP) &mdash; train a neural network to predict non-linear data (in this case, two parabolas)
* [webcam](https://codepen.io/thekevinscott/pen/Redayj) &mdash; train an image classifier with a webcam using transfer learning

# Libraries

* [`make_moons`](https://thekevinscott.github.io/make_moons/) is a port from scikit's `make_moons` function. It generates two parabolas of x,y points.
* [`ml-classifier`](https://thekevinscott.github.io/ml-classifier-ui/) is a library written in React for generating image classification models in your browser with drag n drop.
* [`tfjs-vis`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-vis) is a library for visualizing your models right in your app.

# Educational Resources
I've got a few articles you can read on machine learning specifically in Javascript:

* [What's a tensor?](/tensors-in-javascript/)
* [A guide to Image Classification in Javascript](/image-classification-with-javascript/)
* [Reasons to do Machine Learning in Javascript](/reasons-for-machine-learning-in-the-browser/)

## Some things I glossed over in the talk that you can learn more about:

* [What's an optimizer](https://blog.algorithmia.com/introduction-to-optimizers/)
* [What's an activation function](https://medium.com/the-theory-of-everything/understanding-activation-functions-in-neural-networks-9491262884e0)
* [What is transfer learning](http://ruder.io/transfer-learning/)

## Information on Tensorflow.js
The [Tensorflow.js](https://js.tensorflow.org) docs contain a wealth of information about the library.

Another useful resource is the official [Tensorflow.js examples repo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples), with code demonstrating a number of popular machine learning techniques with live demos.

The [Tensorflow playground](https://playground.tensorflow.org) predates Tensorflow.js. It lets you build a neural net in your browser and see the training in real time.

## Courses

There are a number of great courses for learning Artificial Intelligence.

[Fast.ai](http://www.fast.ai/) puts out a series of video lectures aimed at hackers. The courses are done in Python.

[Andrew Ng's Coursera course](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/) is widely recognized as one of the best introductions to AI and machine learning.
