## A word on Typed Arrays

A history of JS typed arrays.

Typed Arrays are a relatively new feature in the world of Javascript. They were introduced because of X. You need them when workin with WEbGL which Tensorflow does.

I found it useful to go through a refresher on these bad boys, since they're so at the core of all this stuff.
